Tetris inspired casual arcade game. 

So far I have completed the prototype  to figure out the implementation of the core game mechanics. The prototype is functional with few rare bugs which can be easily fixed on next update. 
Currently the main issue is that the game is too easy and it is actually difficult to lose. I have some ideas which I'll test to solve this and make the game more fun. 

Planned to release on Google Play Store as a casual arcade game.
